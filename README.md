## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
We modeled miles per gallon(mpg) as dependent variable against multiple metrics,
such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance,
were collected for each vehicle as predictors(independent variables) using linear
regression. The output of the multiple linear regression is shown:

 From the results, there is statistical evidence that at least one of the multiple metrics
have significant effect on MPG (F (5,44) =22.07, p&lt;0.05). In Table 1, the significant metrics
are ground clearance (p&lt;0.05) and vehicle length (p&lt;0.05) with an R-square value of
0.7149. These two metrics have positive effects on the mpg, explaining about 71.5% of
the total variations in mpg. An R-square value of about 71.5% shows a good model to
predict mpg.
